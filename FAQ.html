                <strong>What Financial Aid is available to me?</strong>
                <ul>
                   <li>You can fill out the FAFSA to be considered for government aid which includes Pell Grant, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, and Parent Plus Loans.</li>
                   <li>There are also scholarships offered through the university which include Academic Scholarships, University Scholarships, and Talent Awards. Visit this page for more information (link to http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/about-financial-aid)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
           
           <ul>
                <strong>What is the FAFSA form and where do I find it?</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>FAFSA is a Free Application for Federal Student Aid. You can find this by going to www.fafsa.ed.gov.</li>
                </ul>
            
            </ul>
           
           
            <strong> What do I find under the Finances tab on my.byui? </strong>
                Several links found under the Finances tab are important regarding Financial Aid:
                -View Financial Aid Document Tracking: You will be able to use this page to see what documents we have received from you and what documents we are still requesting for you to turn in. 
                -View Financial Aid Awards: You will be able to see the awards you qualify for on this page once you have been awarded. You will need to go here to accept or decline your loan offers. You can also see how many credit hours are required to receive each award you have qualified for. 
            <strong>What deadlines do I need to be aware of?</strong>
                Priority deadlines guarantee that your aid will be in before the tuition late charge date for the semester. They are as follows:
            <ul>
                <u><strong>Fall Semester (September-December)</strong></u>

           <strong>What are the steps to receiving Federal Aid?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill out the FAFSA at fafsa.ed.gov</li>
                    <li>Check your document tracking within 4-5 business days to see if we have received it
                    <li>Continue checking your document tracking to see if you are required to submit documents to our office 
                    <li>Your award will be processed 6-8 weeks from the time you submitted your last complete document. 
                </ul>
                
                <strong>What is the FAFSA form?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>FAFSA is a Free Application for Federal Student Aid which can be found at www.fafsa.ed.gov. The FAFSA determines
                        financial need for the Federal student aid programs. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>What is the Verification process?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>At BYU-Idaho, the Financial Aid Office is required by federal regulations to verify student's files. This means those
                        who are randomly selected will be required to submit further documents to our office before we can process an award.

                <strong>How do I know if I am selected for Verification?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>After you submit your FAFSA, you will need to check your document tracking page (under the Finance tab on your my.byui account).
                        This will show you what we have received from you and if you are required to submit any documents to our office to verify.

                </ul>
                
                <strong>What do I need to do if I am selected for Verification?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you are selected for Verification, you will need to submit the documents that are listed as missing on your Document Tracking
                            page. These will need to be submitted before we can continue processing your financial aid award. Click here for more information

                <strong>What is the difference between the different loans?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stafford Loans are a series of fixed-rate student loans for undergraduate and graduate students attending college at least half-time
                        (six credits or more). Students are considered for these loan offers based on the FAFSA.
                    </li>
                
                    <li>Direct Subsidized Loan: The Direct Subsidized Loan has a 3.4% APR interest rate and the federal government pays the interest on the
                        loan while the student is in school. Principle and Interest payments are postponed while students are enrolled in at least six credits
                        and during their grace period.
                    </li>
                    <li>Direct Unsubsidized Loan: The Direct Unsubsidized Loan has a 6.8% APR interest rate and the student responsible for the accrued interest
                        while they are in school. Principle payments are postponed while students are enrolled in at least six credits and during their grace period. </li>
                    <li>Plus Loan: A Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) is a federal guaranteed loan and is available for a parent of dependent undergraduate
                        students. The parent may borrow up to the student's annual cost of attendance minus any financial assistance the student has been or will be awarded
                        during the period of enrollment. The Parent Loan has a 7.9% APR interest rate and repayment begins within 60 days after the loan has been fully disbursed.
                        Interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made (on the first semester amount only until the second half is disbursed). Students
                        and Parents will need to re-apply every academic year for the loan.
                    </li>

                </ul>
                
                <strong>What is the Grace Period?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Grace period is where students are not required to start repayment until six months after dropping below six credits. If a student defers a semester
                        and is below six credits for more than six months, repayment will start and their grace period will have been used up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>When will I get my Federal Aid Award?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you submitted a FAFSA and were not selected for verification, you will be awarded within 6-8 weeks.</li>
                    If you submitted a FAFSA and were selected for verification, you will be awarded 6-8 weeks from the time you submitted your last complete document. 
                </ul>
       
                <strong>When will my financial aid be disbursed?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial aid awards (scholarships, grants and/or loans) are disbursed within the first week of the semester only if the student has completed all of
                        the requirements by the priority deadline. Occasionally, some financial aid awards will be disbursed earlier or later than others. However, there is no
                        guarantee date for disbursement.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>How do I know if my financial aid has been disbursed?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial aid award funds are released into a student's Personal Account Summary (link to this page). It can be found under the heading 'Available
                        and Disbursed Financial Aid/Scholarships.' If financial aid awards have been released, there will be account names and balances under this heading on the page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>How can I use financial aid funds?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Financial aid funds are intended to be used for education costs. Initially, your financial aid should be used first to cover your tuition costs and any tuition
                        (class) based fees. Remaining financial aid funds can then be used to pay off any outstanding school balances, books, school supplies, and any living expense you incur
                        while completing your education, such as: housing, travel expenses, insurance, and food expenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Please note, certain financial aid awards, such as some private scholarships, have requirements limiting their use only for tuition based costs.</li>
