<p>There is nothing wrong with pulling out student loans, however there are a few things you should consider and plan for before you do so.</p>

<p>Students that complete a FAFSA form will receive either a subsidized or unsubsidized loan offer. Only dependent students can be eligible
   for Parent Plus loans. Also, any student who drops below 6 credits is not considered by the servicer to be enrolled in school, and any time
   spent below 6 credits will begin to count towards a student's grace period.

            <p> Loans are borrowed money and must be paid back. There is nothing wrong with pulling out student loans,
	        however, there are a few things you should consider and plan for before you do so. You will want to know the answers to these questions:
	    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>What will be the total amount you will need to borrow for your entire education?</li>
			<li>What are the costs, including interest, to repay the loan?</li>
			<li>What will the monthly payments be and when do I need to start repaying them?</li>
			<li>What penalties are associated with my loan in different circumstances?</li>
		</ul>

		<p> Before a student takes out a loan for the first time, they are required to finish <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank">Entrance Counseling</a>, this walks the student through
		   loan policies and helps educate them on these types of questions.

<div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">Common Mistakes and Misconceptions</span></div>
    <div class="fa_answer">
        <div>
<strong>1. Student loans are bad</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: Student loans may be the only option for a student to pay for a college education</li>

 <br><br>
<strong>2. Students are required to take out the whole loan amount offered</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: When you accept your student loan, you may choose how much of the award you accept</li>

 <br><br>
<strong>3. It is better to take out the loan that has the lowest award amount</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: Unsubsidized loans can be a smaller loan amount, but interest accrues on the funds
				taken out while a student is going to school. If you do not need a lot of loan funds,
				accept a portion of the subsidized loan to avoid accruing interest.
    </li>

 <br><br>
<strong>4. Only full-time students (12 credits) can receive loans</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: Students can receive loan funds if enrolled in less than 12 credits. They must be enrolled
				in at least 6 credits to receive any student loans. Student enrolled in 6-11 credits will have their
				award amount prorated according to the amount of credits they are taking. Students need to let their
				financial aid counselor know their credit level will be different.
    </li>

 <br><br>
 
 
 
 
<strong>5. You have to pay off your student loan before you go on your mission</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: A student does not have to have all of their student loans paid off before going on a mission.
				However, because you will be out of school for more than 6 months, your <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA"> servicer </a>
				will start to bill you. You are responsible for contacting your servicer to see what your options are while you are on your mission.
    </li>
 <br><br>
<strong>6. I don't have to pay back my loans until after I graduate so I don't' need to worry about what I have pulled out until then</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: Students are not required to pay back their student loans until they have dropped below 6 credits for more than 6 months.
        However, unsubsidized loans will accrue interest while a student is in school. Students are also responsible to be aware and keep track of the interest
        that will accrue. <a href=http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA>Click here for more information.</a>
    </li>
 <br><br>
<strong>7. Loan money can only be used on tuition</strong>
    <li style=margin-left:.5cm>Fact: Scholarships, Pell grants, student loans and other forms of financial aid used at BYU-Idaho will automatically go towards
				tuition and any other debts to the school first. Anything left over is yours to use responsibly for any other school expenses that you may have.

<div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">What is the cost of taking out a student loan?</span></div>
    <div class="fa_answer">
        <div>
        <p>All student loans have an origination fee. This is explained in your MPN and Entrance Counseling. This fee is simply taken out of the loan funds that you accept, so the money that you receive will be less than the funds that you accept. 
	Interest is the cost of borrowing money. Interest accrues on all Direct Unsubsidized loans and Parent Plus Loans while a student is going to school. You can figure out how much you will end up repaying by using an 
		<a href=http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans> Interest calculator. </a>
        </p>

<div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">Repaying Loans</span></div>
    <div class="fa_answer">
        <div>
        <p>Have you already pulled out a student loan? <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds_SA"> Check your account </a> and with your servicer to see where you currently stand with you loans.
	The church offers a Debt-Elimination Calendar found in <a href="http://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/language-materials/33293_eng.pdf" target="_blank"> “One for the Money: A Guide to Family Finance” </a>
	(page 12) that can help you make a plan to pay off or reduce your debt. It is never too early to begin repaying your student loans.

<div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">Grace Period</span></div>
    <div class="fa_answer">
        <div>
        <p>
		Students are required to begin paying back their loans once they drop below 6 credits for 6 months. These 6 months are called a “Grace Period”. If you use up your grace
		period and return to school, you are not required to pay while you are enrolled, but you no longer have a grace period once you fall below the 6-credit level again.

<br />

<p>The most essential thing that you can do before taking out a loan is <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/planning-ahead/budgeting" target="_blank"> making a plan first. </a>
	If you plan ahead and know what your <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/planning-ahead/resources" target="_blank"> resources </a>    and <a href="http://www.byui.edu/financial-aid/planning-ahead/expenses" target="_blank"> expenses </a> are, you will know ahead of time how much you need to pull out in student loans rather than not knowing and taking
	out more than you need.</p>
