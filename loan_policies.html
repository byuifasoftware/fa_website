<p> Accepting Federal Loans for financial assistance through schooling can be like walking into unfamiliar territory for a lot of students. There is a lot of information to cover
    to ensure that students are aware of their responsibilities with the loan, especially when it comes to repayment. The following tabs below
    contain pertinent information you may want to review and understand before accepting a loan offer.</p>




<div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">Borrower responsibilities</span></div>
    <div class="fa_answer">
        <div>
           <p>Borrowers have agreed to many responsibilities and obligations. Borrowers (students and or parents) need to understand the following responsibilities
                concerning their loan.
                For more information visit <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">loan servicers</a>
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintain contact and communication with loan servicers</strong> &ndash; Borrowers can identify their <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/PORTALSWebApp/students/english/FSALoanServicers.jsp" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #2864c8;" title="Studentaid.ed.gov Loan Servicer list">loan servicers</a> by visiting <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #2864c8;" title="NSLDS.ed.gov">NSLDS.ed.gov</a>. Servicers regularly send messages and communicate; to borrowers. Loan servicers routinely send messages regarding: disbursement notifications, interest bills, enrollment changes, grace period notifications, interest notices, and repayment notifications/obligations (view a typical loan servicers <a href="http://www.myfedloan.org/schools/our-services/services-borrowers/timeline.shtml" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #2864c8;" title="FedLoan Borrower Communication Timeline"> communication timeline</a>).
                <p class="min_space">The student is responsible to inform the servicer of the following:</p>
            
                <ul class="inner_list">
                    <li>If there is a name change</li>
                    <li>If the permanent address changes</li>
                    <li>If the Social Security number changes</li>
                    <li>If the projected graduation date changes</li>
                    <li>If the student withdraws from school</li>
                    <li>If the student transfers to another school</li>
                    <li>If the student drops below half-time status (below 6 credits)</li>
                    <li>If the student desires to apply for a deferment or a forbearance</li>
                    <li>If the student is having any difficulty repaying the loan</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p><small>The student should retain copies of all letters sent to the servicer. The student is also encouraged to log all telephone calls to the servicer, noting dates, the name of the person contacted, and what he/she was told.</small></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Confirm Enrollment Verification with loan servicer</strong> &ndash; Loan servicers check a student&rsquo;s enrollment status on the National Student Clearinghouse (to see if students are enrolled at least half-time or six credits). The National Student Clearinghouse is not updated until approximately a month into the semester. If a student is not listed as currently enrolled, they will most likely receive notification from their servicer that they are entering repayment. Students can print and send to the servicer their <a href="http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/studentverification.htm" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #2864c8;" title="BYU-Idaho Enrollment Verification - Student Records Office">Enrollment Verification</a> (accessible from the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/registrarsoffice/" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 500; color: #2864c8;" title="Student Records and Registrars Office link">Student Records and Registrars Office</a>). Enrollment Verification is a document that confirms periods (semesters) of school attendance and credit levels. Ultimately, the student is responsible to inform or correct the loan servicer of any errors or inaccuracies regarding a student&rsquo;s enrollment status,<em> not the Financial Aid Office</em>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repay loans after grace period expires</strong>- When a student leaves school, he/she will not be required to begin repaying the loan immediately. Stafford Direct Loans allow a six-month &ldquo;grace period&rdquo; that starts when a student leaves school or drops below half-time (six credits) enrollment. A student may request a shorter grace period if he/she wishes. If a student has unsubsidized loans, he/she can reduce the amount of interest that accrues on the loan by requesting a shorter grace period and beginning repayment earlier.<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Grace periods</strong> are day-specific; that is, an initial grace period begins on the day immediately following the day that a student stops attending school at least half time (six credits) and ends on the day before the repayment period begins. The initial grace period isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;used up&rdquo; during shorter periods of non-enrollment. For instance, if a student misses a semester (4 months), but resumes his/her studies at least half-time (six credits), he/she will still be eligible for the full 6-month grace period when he/she graduates.</li>

            <div>
                <p>Borrowers will not be penalized by making early repayment on their loans. Making early payments on a student loan before a grace period is expired does not obligate the borrower to continue making payments.</p>

        <div class="fa_answer">
            <div>
                <p>Deferments are provided in the law. They are the temporary postponement of payment under special circumstances. During deferment, the student's monthly principal payments are postponed, and the federal government pays the interest on subsidized Federal Direct Loans. For an Unsubsidized Federal Direct borrower, monthly payments are postponed, but the student is responsible for all the interest that accrues. Depending on which deferment the student qualifies for, the length of the deferment varies. Students must apply for the deferment in writing, using a form provided by the servicer.</p>
                <h3>Deferment types</h3>

                <p>Borrowers with outstanding Federal Education Loans disbursed before July 1, 1993. Check with the loan servicer.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The U.S. Department of Education has indicated that a borrower who is serving in a religious proselytizing capacity (missionary service) and is not employed during that period may qualify for a forebearance or reduced payment.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- End of .right_container -->
                <p>Borrowers with an outstanding balance on a Stafford Loan prior to July 1, 1993, do not qualify for the hardship deferment and must apply for a forbearance.</p>
                
                 <h4 style="text-indent: 0;">Forbearance</h4>
                 <hr>
                <p>If students are not eligible for deferment, but are experiencing some financial difficulty, they may apply for a forbearance. A forbearance is a servicer option. Forbearance is the temporary cessation of payments or acceptance of smaller payments than were previously scheduled. The servicer may grant forbearance for principal, interest, or both. Forbearance requires a written agreement between the borrower and servicer. Unlike periods of deferment, the borrower is responsible for repayment of interest which accrues during forbearance.</p>

    <div class="fa_question"><span class="h4">Consolidation</span></div>
        <div class="fa_answer">
            <div>  
                <p>Consolidation is the combining of existing student loans into one new loan. Generally, this results in lower monthly payments, but higher interest costs.</p>
                <p>Married couples are now allowed to consolidate their individual loans if they agree to be held jointly and separately liable for repayment without regard to the amount of the individual indebtedness and any future changes in their marital status.</p>
                <p>The interest rate on the unpaid principal balance for Consolidation Loans is the lesser of the weighted average of the interest rates on loans being consolidated, rounded up to the nearest higher one-eighth of 1 percent or 8.25%.</p>
                <p>If a student took out their first loan before July 1, 1993, and consolidate it after July 1, 1993, they will be eligible for fewer deferments. For more information about consolidation, students can contact their servicer (Visit <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov" title="Link to NSLDS.ed.gov">NSLDS.ed.gov</a> to identify loan servicers).</p>

        <div class="fa_answer">
            <div>  
                <p>If a student fails to make payments for six months or more, their loan will go into default. Defaulting on a loan is a serious matter. When the student enters default, the student will immediately become ineligible for any Title IV funding at any school. In the event of default, the student's guarantee agency purchases the loan from his/her servicer and begins collection activity against him/her until the loan has been repaid. This activity may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Reporting the student's default to a credit bureau.</li>
                <li>Reporting the student's default to the Internal Revenue Service, causing their federal tax refunds to be withheld and applied toward their loan balance. Many states also withhold state income tax refunds.</li>
                <li>Garnishing the student's wages</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If a student is having difficulty making their payments, they need to contact their servicer or guarantee agency immediately. Many problems can be resolved, and there may be deferment or forbearance options available them.</p>

                <p>All student loans have an origination fee. This is explained in your MPN and Entrance Counseling. This fee is simply taken out of the loan funds that you accept, so the money that you receive will be less than the funds that you accept. </p>
