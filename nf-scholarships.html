<p>In an effort to bolster student need-based aid and student employment, the following changes are being made:</p>
<ul>
<li>All University Scholarships (with the exceptions of talent and leadership scholarships) are evaluated through the BYU-Idaho Scholarship Application <small>(Heber J. Grant)</small>.</li>
<li>There are no longer automatic considerations for any university scholarships.</li>
<li>This change is taking place in order to allow students to be considered for more financial aid opportunities. By completing this one comprehensive application, students will be evaluated for both Academic Scholarships and all other General Scholarships offered at BYU-Idaho.</li>
<li>The Academic Scholarship GPA requirements are changing (see Academic Scholarships for Continuing Students below).</li>
<li>The Application was open November 1, 2012 and closed April 1, 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p>If students are admitted after April 1st, or if they return from their mission after April 1st, they will be given an opportunity to complete the application. These students must contact our office at: <a href="mailto:scholarships@byui.edu">scholarships@byui.edu</a></p>
<span class="h4">The process is easy:</span>
<ul>
<li>Complete the 2013-2014 BYU-Idaho Scholarship Application <small>(Heber J. Grant)</small> by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 1, 2013</span></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Your application information along with your GPA, major, credits earned, etc. will be compared to the criteria of all available scholarships offered at BYU-Idaho. If you meet the qualifications of a particular scholarship(s) you will then be considered for that award. Your award could possibly include an Academic Scholarship, a General BYU-Idaho Scholarship, or both.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<ul>
<li>You will be notified by the end of May 2013 of any possible awards.</li>
