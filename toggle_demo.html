        <h3>How to Fill out the FAFSA, Sign and Submit it</h3>
            <div>
                <li>The FAFSA is a Free Application for Federal Student Aid and can be found by going to www.fafsa.ed.gov/.</li>
                <li>If you have never filled out the FAFSA before, you will want to start a new FAFSA application. If you have filled one out before in a different
                    academic year, you can login and proceed with filling out the new application.</li>
                <li>Please make sure you know your social security number and birthday as you will need these to log in. </li>
                <li>If you have never filled out a FAFSA before, you will also need to apply for a pin. This is something you will need to remember as you will use it
                    every time you log in to your FAFSA as well as every time you sign and submit your FAFSA.</li>
                <li>You can proceed by answering the questions throughout the application. If you are filling out the application for the 2012-2013 Academic Year, you
                    will need to provide income information from 2011.  (Attend school anytime during Summer Session 2012, Fall 2012, Winter 2013, and Spring 2013.)
                    For the 2013-2014 Academic Year, you will need to provide income information from 2012. (Attend school anytime during Summer Session 2013, Fall 2013, Winter 2014, and Spring 2014.)</li>
                <li>If you are independent, you will only need your income information and your spouse (if applicable). If you are dependent, you will need your income information as
                    well as your parent(s) income information.</li>
                <li>After you have completely filled out the FAFSA, you will need to sign it electronically with the pin you applied for and submit it. </li>
                <li>If you are a dependent student, your parent will also need to apply for a pin and sign the FAFSA electronically before it can be submitted. They will
                    need to remember this pin as well so that if you ever go back in to make corrections or to fill out a new FAFSA for a new academic year, that parent
                    will need to use that pin to sign your FAFSA.</li>
                <li>After you sign and submit it, it will take 4-5 business days for our office to receive it.</li>
                <li>You will see that we have received your FAFSA on your  Document Tracking page as well as any documents you need to turn in to our office.</li>
                <li>Log into your MyBYUI account, click on the Finances Tab then on 'View Financial Aid Document Tracking'.</li>

        <h3>How to Use the Data Retrieval Option</h3>
            <div>
                <li>If you were selected for verification and need to submit IRS Tax Return Transcripts for yourself or your parents, you can log back into your FAFSA and use the Data Retrieval Tool.</li>
                <li>This option automatically links taxes from the IRS to the FAFSA and if it works successfully, you will not have to turn in physical tax return transcripts to our office.</li>
                <li>To do this, you will need to log back into your FAFSA and click on the link that says 'Make FAFSA Corrections'.</li>
                <li>You will then want to click on the tab that says 'Financial Information'. </li>
                <li>If you provided parent income information, you will see this first. </li>
                <li>Your parent (s) will only be able to complete the data retrieval option if they have already filed their taxes for 2011 and if they do not apply to any of
                    the option listed (filed an amended  tax return, filed separately, recently filed, etc.) </li>
                <li>If your parent (s) can select 'None of the Above' on this list, then they should be able to complete the Data Retrieval option by clicking on that link.
                    This will open up a new window linking to the IRS website where the parent will need to enter the address that was reported on their taxes and answer any
                    other question needed on this page. </li>
                <li>Please note, if your address is 123 N, do not spell out North. Simply put the letter N. This goes for any direction in your address. </li>
                <li>After you have entered the correction information, your parent will need to click the 'Link' button. If it brings you directly back to the FAFSA page and
                    says it was successful, then you have done it correctly.</li>
                <li>If you need to link your own taxes, you can click 'Next' on your FAFSA application which will bring you to Student Financial Information and follow the same steps as above.</li>
                <li>If linked successfully, you will need to resign and resubmit the application. Simply saving it will not resubmit it.</li>
                <li>To resign and resubmit it, click on the tab 'Sign & Submit' at the top. You will need to sign it electronically with your pin, and if you are a dependent
                    student your parent will need to sign it electronically with their pin as well. The FAFSA can then be resubmitted.</li>
                <li>Our office will receive the corrections in 4-5 business days. This will also show up on your document tracking, and if done successfully, we will no
                    longer be requesting you to turn in Return Transcripts to our office.</li>

        <h3>How To Order an IRS Return Transcript</h3>
            <div>
                <li>If for any reason you cannot complete the Data Retrieval Option on the FAFSA, you will need to contact the IRS directly to order one from them.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind, if you recently filed, a return transcript will not be available to you for 6-8 weeks if you paper filed and 2-3 weeks if you filed electronically.</li>
                <li>To order the Return Transcript, you can go to www.irs.gov </li>
                <li>Under the Tools bar, click on the link that says 'Order a Return or Account Transcript'.</li>
                <li>Under step three, you can click on 'Order a Transcript' to order one online or you can call the number listed to order one over the phone.</li>
                <li>If you click on the link to order one online, you will need to enter your social security number, your date of birth, and the street address that matches the exact
                    address reported on your taxes. Please make sure you enter it exactly as it appears on your taxes.</li>
                <li>After you click continue, you will need to select which transcript to order and for which year. Please make sure you order the TAX RETURN TRANSCRIPT! You will
                    also need to select the 2011 Tax Year if you are applying for 2012/2013 Financial Aid.</li>
                <li>After you have done this and submitted your order, you will receive the Tax Return Transcript through the mail to the address you provided in 7-10 business days.</li>
                <li>Once you receive the Return Transcript, you will need to submit a copy to our office so we can process the document.   Please make sure that your name and I # is written on
                    the top of the page.</li>

             <h3>How to Fix a Rejected Signature</h3>
            <div>
                <li>If you pull up your document tracking and see that you are missing any of the following: Rejected Missing Signature, Estimated Student Taxes, and/or Estimated Parent Taxes, you
                    will need to make corrections on your FAFSA.</li>
                <li>If you see Rejected Missing Signature, this means that either you and/or your parent did not sign the FAFSA with your pin before submitting it.  (A “Signature” for the FAFSA is
                    done using your 4 digit PIN that you should have already applied for and received.)</li>
                <li>To fix this, you will need to log back into your FAFSA application. After you have done this, it should bring you right to a page saying that you did not sign the FAFSA and
                    there should be a link that says 'Provide Signatures'.</li>
                <li>When you click on this, it will automatically bring you to a page for you to provide a signature for yourself and / or your parent to sign for themselves.</li>
                <li>Enter the appropriate information needed, sign it electronically with your pin, and resubmit the FAFSA.</li>
                <li>Keep checking your document tracking over the next 4-5 business days to make sure it was submitted properly and that you are no longer missing 'Rejected Missing Signature'.
                    Keep checking this as well to see if you have any further documents to submit to our office.</li>

           <h3>How to Fix Estimated Taxes</h3>
            <div>
                <li>If you see under missing documents that you have 'Parent Estimated Tax' and/or 'Student Estimated Tax', this means you need to update the financial information you provided on your FAFSA</li>
                <li>Log back in to the FAFSA and click on the link that says 'Make Corrections to FAFSA' and then click on the tab at the top that says 'Financial Information'</li>
                <li>The first question on this page asks if you (or your parent if you provided parent information) filed taxes in 2011. Your answer to this question was that either you or your parent 'will file'
                    and needs to be updated to 'already filed' or 'will not file', whichever is applicable.</li>
                
                <li>If you update it and put that you already filed your taxes, you will either need to complete the Data Retrieval Option to pull in your taxes automatically from the IRS or you will need to enter
                    the income information exactly as it appears on your taxes (or your parent taxes if you are updating parent income).</li>
                <li>Once you have completed this, you will need to sign and resubmit the FAFSA, not just save the corrections.  Click on the 'Sign & Submit' tab at the top and sign electronically with your pin.</li>
                <li>If you are a dependent student and provided parent information, your parent will need to sign electronically with their pin as well. You can then resubmit the FAFSA.</li>
                <li>This will show up on your document tracking within 4-5 business days. Once it does, you should see that you are no longer missing Parent and/or Student Estimated Taxes. Keep checking this as well
                    to see if you have any further documents to submit to our office.</li>
